export const generalFaqs = [
  {
    q: "Do you take remote or international clients?",
    a: "Yes. Roughly a third of our work is outside Indore. Everything up to working drawings is handled remotely over shared drawings and calls, with a site survey either by our team or by your contractor against our checklist. Out-of-city site visits are planned in advance and billed at cost.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does a typical gym design project take?",
    a: "Six to ten weeks from first call to a full drawing set for a floor between 3,000 and 8,000 sq ft. Concept lands in weeks two to three, layout is frozen around week four, and working drawings follow. Larger floors and multi-level spaces run longer.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you only design gyms, or other fitness and wellness spaces too?",
    a: "Gyms are the core, but the same thinking applies to pilates, yoga and cycling studios, recovery and physiotherapy spaces, and the fitness floors inside hotels and residential clubhouses.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the process from first call to completed space?",
    a: "Understand, Research, Plan, Design, Build, Learn. A 30-minute discovery call, a shell and business review, zoning and circulation, then concept, lighting, 3D views and dimensioned drawings. Your contractor builds; we stay available for drawing queries and review the floor once it has been running.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you handle execution and build, or design only?",
    a: "Design and drawings only. Construction, fit-out, procurement and site labour sit with your own contractor under your contract. It keeps our advice on materials and equipment independent of who is supplying them.",
  },
  {
    q: "What information do you need before the first consultation?",
    a: "Floor area, city, a rough equipment list or member target, and any drawing of the shell you already have — even a broker's plan. Photos or a walkthrough video of the raw space help more than anything else.",
  },
];

export const startFaqs = [
  {
    q: "Can you work on a gym outside my city?",
    a: "Yes — remote projects are normal here. Drawings, calls and a structured site survey cover most of it, with planned visits where the floor needs eyes on it.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's a typical timeline?",
    a: "Six to ten weeks from first call to a complete drawing set for most floors.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the first call work?",
    a: "Thirty minutes. Your space, your model, your peak hour. You leave with an initial view on capacity and layout whether or not we work together.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you build the space too?",
    a: "No. Design and drawings only — your own contractor executes, and we support them through the build with drawing clarifications.",
